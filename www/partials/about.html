                Hi! I'm Connor, a mobile/web developer and this is my personal web site where I hope to give you
                an idea of who I am. As a graduate of Arizona State University, I have earned my B.S. in Computer
                Information Systems with a certificate in Small Business &amp; Entrepreneurship. I have a diverse
                skill set with knowledge in the major development languages including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java
                and more. I absolutely love turning ideas into reality and creating applications that are both
                visually appealing and useful. You can view some of my work here.
                <!--TODO: link to projects-->
                When it comes to development, I've come a long way in learning and truly understanding the best
                practices and standards that are crucial in order to design a high quality application.
                Some frameworks that I enjoy and have had success building with are are AngularJS and Twitter Bootstrap.
            </p>

                Although I have experience with and am comfortable building Android applications, I have recently begun
                researching and diving into hybrid app development where I hope to create some awesome web applications
                that look and feel like native apps. I am fascinated by every aspect of development. From the design and visual appeal to the back end
                implementation, I have experience in every stage of the process. However, my expertise and greatest
                satisfaction lies in data handling and functionality, building the bridge between the front end and back
                end. I have goals to become a full-stack developer and be able to manage both the front end and back end
                as well as all layers of an application. I have a strong interest in social applications, connecting others
                with like interests and providing value through interactions.
            </p>
            <h3>Interests</h3>

                When I'm not in front of a computer screen I love being outside. I go running, mountain biking, hiking
                and enjoy attending music festivals. During the winter months, I will most likely be up in the mountains
                skiing. This past summer, I went on a 7 week backpacking trip through Europe which sparked a love for
                traveling. I have an innate desire to explore the world and experience other countries. This passion has
                led to some fun projects that I've been working on regarding travel applications.
                <br><br>If you'd like to learn more about me or reach out for any reason, feel free to contact me here.
